This is a public project just to develop with some new stuff like Spring Boot, Spring Data Solr and so on.

The main goal is:
 - to consume some Rest API (such as Google: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/news?v=1.0&q=);
 - map the result into some JSON object, extracting interesting information to store it in a Solr Index;
 - provide a good way to consume this information through an intuitive Controller.
 

P.S. I know that maybe it isn't a silver bullet application (and I'm sure that it even has a lot of functionality), however, the desire here is to practice some Java coding - not building a space shuttle.

Lets relax, code and have fun!
